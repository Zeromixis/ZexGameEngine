Build instruction for Windows with Visual Studio 2008 and above:
================================================================
1. Set enviroment variables in command shell:
set CMAKE_ROOT = <Your path to cmake directory> - REQUIRED

set BOOST_ROOT = <Your path to Boost directory> (Can be the headers only, no building of boost required) - OPTIONAL, but needed for UnitTests
set DOXYGEN_ROOT = <Your path to cmake directory> - OPTIONAL otherwise no documentation generated

Start CMake:
e.g.
cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" <Absolute Path to TypeInfo source code directory>
or with make files:
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "NMake Makefiles" <Absolute Path to TypeInfo source code directory>



Build instruction for Linux with g++:
================================================================
1. Set enviroment variables in your shell:
CMAKE_ROOT => <Your path to cmake directory> - REQUIRED

BOOST_ROOT => <Your path to Boost directory> (Can be the headers only, no building of boost required) - OPTIONAL, but needed for UnitTests
DOXYGEN_ROOT => <Your path to cmake directory> - OPTIONAL otherwise no documentation generated

Start CMake:
e.g.
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release <Absolute Path to TypeInfo source code directory>
